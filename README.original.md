# Ps360ProDrummer - Original Readme

*This contents of this README were taking directly from the original
project page at http://code.google.com/p/ps360prodrummer/. Credits to
bastian.damman@gmail.com for his work on this project.*

## Summary

With this program you can connect your Rock Band 3 Pro drum with cymbals or
Xbox360 GHWT/GH5 drum to your computer and play it like a real e-drum! 

It reads raw usb data from the drum and translates it to midi events. 

## Features
* All pads are supported 
* Velocity sensitive (except kick on ProDrum but that's the hardware) 
* MultiNote ( a soft hit triggers a different note than a hard hit ) 
* Midi 

## Original Program

This program is based on the code of PS360Drum which was essentially the same but for the guitar hero world tour kit. It was made by Magnus Ellinge so all credit about finding out how to interface USB and MIDI goes to him. 

# My Work

* Making it work for the Rock Band 3 Pro Drum 
* A hit filter: prevents double hitting 
* Rewritten/reorganized the code 
* New GUI 

## Note

Works for PS3 RockBand Pro Drum and xbox360 GHWT/GH5 Drum
