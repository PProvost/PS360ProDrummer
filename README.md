# PS360ProDrummer

This program lets you use your Xbox 360 GHWT/GH5 drum kit, and your PS3 RB Pro
drum kit, with your PC as a MIDI controller. If you already have a drum kit
on your game console and want to play a few beats into your favorite MIDI
software (e.g. Ableton Live or Addictive Drums), then this is a great way
to get started.

To use this with your DAW or software drum machine, you need to install a
virtual MIDI cable such as [LoobBe1][1]. Then you configure PS360ProDrummer to
use that as its output, and use the "other end" as the input to your DAW.

This repository is a clone of bastian.damman's [ps360prodrummer][2] repository
on google code. His project is a continuation of the now-unavailable
PS360MidiDrummer project originally created by Magnus Ellinge.

If you are looking for binaries of this project, please visit the googlecode
site linked above as bastian has them there. I will not be producing binaries
here. This repository exists only for my own benefit, so I don't ever lose this
code (and it has disappeared already once in the past).
